# MetaRAG-LC
A Metadata-Augmented, Query-Aware Retrieval Architecture for High-Precision RAG Systems


# 🏆 MetaRAG-LC  
## Query-Aware Metadata-Augmented Retrieval Architecture

MetaRAG-LC is a research-inspired Retrieval-Augmented Generation system designed to improve semantic retrieval precision through structured metadata augmentation and controlled embedding strategies.

Unlike conventional RAG pipelines that embed raw text chunks, MetaRAG-LC introduces:

- LLM-based semantic metadata generation  
- Selective metadata embedding control  
- Query-aware chunk representation  
- Hybrid retrieval readiness  
- Modular architecture for experimentation  

---

## 🧠 Architectural Philosophy

MetaRAG-LC is built on the premise that:

> Retrieval performance depends more on indexing quality than on model size.

Instead of scaling LLM parameters, this system improves:

- Representation fidelity  
- Semantic alignment  
- Embedding clarity  
- Retrieval precision  

Through structured metadata engineering.
