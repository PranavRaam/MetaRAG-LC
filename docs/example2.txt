This is a sample text document for testing the document loader.

== Introduction ==

This file demonstrates how the DocumentLoader handles plain text files.
Each file is loaded with its metadata including source, file path, and file type.

== Key Features ==

1. Supports multiple formats (PDF, TXT, MD)
2. Attaches structural metadata
3. Preserves document identity
4. Enables traceability

== How It Works ==

The loader reads files from disk and creates Document objects.
Each document contains:
- Raw text content
- Metadata dict with source, path, file_type, document_id
- Page information (for PDFs)

This establishes the foundation for the rest of the pipeline.
